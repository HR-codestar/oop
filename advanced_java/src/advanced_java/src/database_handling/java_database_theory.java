/*			Database handling in java - 
										
database is the digital space where we can store large amoount of data making us easy to access and use
easily
we use SQL(Structures Query Language) statements to interact with the data base

driver - 
it is a software component that allows the java application to access a specific database

commands in SQL - 
-select 
-delete
-insert
-update

-execute - this is used to create a new database
-executeUpdate - this is used to give any new data to the database
-executeQuery - this is used to retrive the data in the data base

after creating 

Resultset - 
it stores all the results of the command or the statement given to the database

whenever we call a class.forname("") to load a class and loading a class executes the staic block
in the class

statements - 
these are the instructions given int the SQL to through the driver to the server of the database

connection - 
this creates a connection between the database and the IDE through the SQL



								input from the user - 
								
								
								
there are three keywords needed for this they are PreparedStatement , BufferStatement and the 
InputStreamReader

with the following syntax 

PreparedStatement [name] = [connection object name].PreparedStatement("insert into [table name] values(? , ? , ? ,....)");
BufferReader [name] = new BufferReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in);
